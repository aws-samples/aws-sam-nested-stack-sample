# Serverless Shopping Cart Microservice

This application is a sample application to demonstrate how you could implement a shopping cart microservice using 
serverless technologies on AWS. The backend is built as a REST API interface, making use of [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).



## Useful commands

 * `sam build`          Builds a serverless application and prepares it for subsequent steps
 * `sam deploy`         Deploys an AWS SAM application.
 * `sam init`           Initializes a serverless application with an AWS SAM template
 * `sam logs`           Fetches logs that are generated by your Lambda function.
 * `sam package`        Packages an AWS SAM application.
 * `sam publish`        Publish an AWS SAM application to the AWS Serverless Application Repository
 * `sam validate`       Verifies whether an AWS SAM template file is valid.
